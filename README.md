Advanced AI Project – Feature Selection using Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Machine Learning

This project applies a complete AI pipeline starting from dataset preprocessing, training a supervised machine learning model on the original dataset, and then applying a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for feature selection to reduce dimensionality and improve performance.
The selected ML model is trained and evaluated before and after GA to compare Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.

Includes:

Dataset preprocessing

ML model training (original dataset)

GA-based feature selection

ML model training (reduced dataset)

Performance comparison
